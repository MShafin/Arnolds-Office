## About The Project
The project was a part of a 48 hour Game Jam back in 2016, where we were challenged to build a game with an "Evil Theme". Our team chose to build an indie platfomer style game based in an office setting, where an employee, Arnold, has gone haywire. He has decided to hurt all his coworkers and management, but will take damage whenever he encounters his boss. Try and get the highest score without falling into the hands of HR.

The game and the graphics were developed in collaboration with other team members.
